# TaskPlanning-App
This is application is mainly for todo-list (CRUD) 

Step 1: Install Dependencies
To set up the application, we'll need to install some dependencies for handling HTTP requests and the basic front end:

Express for creating a server.
Nodemon (optional, for development) to automatically restart the server when files change:


npm install express
npm install --save-dev nodemon
